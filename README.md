# Machine Learning --- Speed-Dating

### GOAL: 

Use and apply different statistic model, Machine Learning Algortihm and Neural Network to a Speed Dating data set, to predict a 'macth' between 2 persons.

**Model Applied:**
* Linear Model (LM)
* General Additive Model (GAM)
* Generalised Linear Model (GLM)
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Neural Network
  - NNET
  - Random Forest
  - NeuralNet

### RESULT:


### CONTENT:
This zip folder has the following content

* "Data" folder where the raw and the preprocessed data sets, as well as the key with the variable explanations, are stored
* "RMarkdown" folder where all .Rmd files and pictures (.png). In order to run the .Rmd files to create the html output yourself, please personalise the working directory to this group folder in the following file:
- 0_Index File.Rmd (line 12)

### DATA SOURCE:
The dataset used for this project was found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/annavictoria/speed-dating-experiment/data).
It contains data from several events of a Speed Dating experiment, whereby paricipants were asked to fill out questionnaires and rate themselves and their date partners.
Details of the experiement can be found here http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/stuff_for_blog/sheena.pdf

### HTML OUTPUT:
The main deliverable is stored in the "HTML Output" folder as an html file named "The Algorithm to True Love". It has exactly 30 pages.

> *This project was part of the second semester*
